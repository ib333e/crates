program that lets me look through my music easily.

Look through all my songs / albums / artist
and have details for each album / artist
sort by genre / year / label / mood.


I'm building this with electron:
https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-first-app

At first it's gonna be a list of all the songs in my library

then there will be an album view, then an artist view. then I can add in
the details
